## This folder contains virtual sensors

This folder contains our virtual sensors. CD to this folder and execute "npm run all" to simulate 10 scooters sending updates to our broker. They will send updates for week 19, meaning from 9th of May til' 13th of May (Monday - Friday)

You could edit the allScooters.js file and replace the "scooterAmount"-variable with whatever amount you want to simulate.

"npm run sensor*X*" lets you update a specific scooter. replace X with either 1, 2 or 3. The reason being we only have 3 scripts available for testing purposes.
