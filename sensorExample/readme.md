## This folder contains virtual sensors

This folder contains our virtual sensors. CD to this folder and execute "npm run all" to simulate 10 scooters sending updates to our broker. They will send updates for week 19, meaning from 9th of May til' 13th of May (Monday - Friday)

You could edit the all.js file and replace the scooterAmount with whatever amount you want to simulate.

"npm run sensor*X*" lets you update a specific scooter. replace X with any number.
