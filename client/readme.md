# Clients

## Example clients

This folder contains clients we used to test subscribing- and publishing to our MQTT server.
Currently you are only able to subscribe to a topic with the client in the folder "client1".

CD to the folder "client1" and run "npm run start" in your terminal to subscribe to our MQTT server through a client.
